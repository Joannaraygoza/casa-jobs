[Techqueria](http://techqueria.org/) is a nonprofit serving the largest community for Latinx in Tech. 🌮

## Welcome to the Casa job board!

The job board is where Techqueria hosts job opportunities for our community. For job seekers, this means seeing available roles, where they're located and where they can apply. For job posters, this means posting their available roles and sharing them with the largest community of Latinx in tech.

This open-source project is built with the community in mind. We share in building the board itself, offering opportunities for community members to contribute to the codebase that makes this all work. We welcome contributions from anyone looking to lend a helping hand, from beginners to seasoned executives. Any small addition to this process will lay a brick in the fountain of resources that Techqueria is trying to provide its members.
