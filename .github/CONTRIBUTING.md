## 1. Setting Up

### Ways to Contribute

> If you are new to open source, we recommend reading [GitHub's open source guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) and their [Hello World tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

Feel free to contribute to the Techqueria website in one or more of the following ways and thank you for being willing to help out! ðŸ˜Š

- Tackle any of the [open issues](https://github.com/techqueria/casa-jobs/issues) that are labeled `help wanted`, `good first issue` or `bug`.
  - If an issue has the label `in progress`, someone is already working on it.
  - If an issue has the label `admin`, an admin probably needs to get involved since it requires admin access.
  - **Even if an issue has someone assigned, it still might need extra help so check it out if it appeals to you!**
- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/techqueria/casa-jobs/issues/new/choose)
- [Report a bug](https://github.com/techqueria/casa-jobs/issues/new?assignees=KGmajor&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D)
- [Request a new feature](https://github.com/techqueria/casa-jobs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFeature+Request%5D)
- Improve our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/techqueria/casa-jobs/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) (this file) or other documentation
- Fix typos or grammar errors on pages or across the code base
- Refactor code
- Anything else you can think of! ðŸ˜†

#### Benefits of Contributing

##### GitHub Profile

You can ask to be added to our GitHub organization.

After you are added you to our Techqueria GitHub organization as a contibutor, you can let the world you've helped us by displaying our organization avatar on your GitHub profile (see screenshot below).

By default, this is made private but you [can easily make it public.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership).

##### LinkedIn

Showcase your contributions through LinkedIn with Techqueria's company profile: https://linkedin.com/company/techqueria.

Just make sure to use the description below and you can briefly describe what you did as well.

```txt
Techqueria is a 501c3 nonprofit serving the largest community for Latinx in Tech.

- Contributed to their open source website through translations and bug fixes
```

Here's an example of how that can be done by posting under "Experience" or "Volunteering" on your LinkedIn profile.

##### Credibility

- You can tell people you've contributed to an open source project - [not that many developers do](https://www.digitalocean.com/currents/october-2018/)!
- You can tell people you have contributed to the largest community for Latinx in Tech  

> And there are [many more reasons](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) why contributing to open source is great!

### Fork the repo

[Fork](https://github.com/techqueria/casa-jobs#fork-destination-box) this repository and clone it locally.

Connect your local to the original "upstream" repository by adding it as [a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/).

Pull in changes from "upstream" often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.

See more detailed instructions through this GitHub article called ["Syncing a Fork"](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
